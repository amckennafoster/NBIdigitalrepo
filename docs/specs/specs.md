# Specifications & Technical Details

## Licenses

There are many license options out there and a nice review is [here](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data) (scroll to the Standard License section). Another repository, figshare, also has a [nice summary](https://knowledge.figshare.com/articles/item/what-is-the-most-appropriate-licence-for-my-data). The Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) (version 4.0) license is recommended for the NBI Digital Repository. There are six main Creative Commons licenses, each with various restrictions, and most do not meet [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) requirements:

- [Attribution (CC BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (Recommended for the NBI Digital Repository)
- Attribution Share Alike (CC BY-SA)
- Attribution No Derivatives (CC BY-ND)
- Attribution Non-Commercial (CC BY-NC)
- Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike (CC BY-NC-SA)
- Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND)

Here is what some of the terms mean:
- Attribution No Derivative: Attribution required, others may redistribute for commercial and noncommercial use but cannot change or break up your original material.
- Attribution Non-Commercial: Attribution required, others may remix and build upon your material non-commercially and their work must also be non-commercial. Derivatives of their work do not have to follow these restrictions.
- Share Alike: Adding this means the original restrictions (e.g. non-commercial) must be applied to derivatives.

Adding derivative or commercial restrictions to a license will make the material (the dataset) less reusable and less interoperable. The Share Alike addition can also cause problems.  [Rathmann (2018)](https://zenodo.org/record/1463156#.XpCh1pl7k2x) provides a great overview of licensing data and the paper is in Zenodo! The following quotes from a variety of sources summarize the impact of restrictions:

> "This means the Share Alike and No Derivatives conditions might have further reaching consequences than intended." ([Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data) )

> "the No Derivatives condition would likely disallow most substantive types of reuse" ([Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data) )

> "Similar to how a non-commercial licence might restrict meaningful reuse of your dataset, a ND \[No Derivative\] license can have the same effect: it may prevent someone from recombining and reusing your data for new research." ([OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/research-data-how-to-license/) )

> "...using a non-commercial licence may prevent researchers from using your data in work destined for publication. This can subsequently affect the dissemination, recognition, and impact of your dataset. And it is definitively NOT open access." ([OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/research-data-how-to-license/) )

> "...the prohibition of monetary compensation may also prevent non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from re-using the data." ([Rathmann (2018)](https://zenodo.org/record/1463156#.XpCh1pl7k2x) )

There is a data specific license available called the [Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/) but it seems that the Creative Commons licenses are a [better option](https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/t/choosing-an-open-data-license-odc-by-vs-cc-by/640/4) for now.

For Creative Commons Licenses, use version 4.0 because this allows a better attribution format (read more at the [Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data))
