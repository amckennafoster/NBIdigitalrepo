# Workflow

## Overview

**Definitions of Roles**

- Researcher: The person or representative of the group of people that produced research outputs that are within the scope of the Repository.

- Wrangler: The NBI committee member who facilitates an NBI funded (or other) researcher's work and has the most knowledge of the individual project.

- Ringleader: The NBI committee member who is responsible for uploading each year's worth of research outputs.

**Researcher Responsibilities:**

Submit a report and metadata form one year after receiving funds from NBI and choose one option for dataset(s):
1. Submit data with report for publication.
2. Submit data with report and agree to the default two year embargo period for publication, or arrange a different embargo timeline.
3. Submit a report only and agree to submit data within two years at which point it can be further embargoed.

**NBI Responsibilities:**

Assist researchers with metadata and data curation to ensure high quality resources on the repository.  High level tasks are:
1. Collect both reports and datasets from reseachers
2. Track embargo periods for individual researchers
3. Curate data to repository standards
4. Apply metadata fully and accurately.
5. Upload research outputs once a year.

## Collecting Reports and Datasets

The Wrangler, the NBI Committee member who works closely with an NBI funded researcher, is the point person for collecting the report and data from the researcher because they are in the best position to apply metadata correctly and easily.  The Wrangler will help the researcher complete three items:

- Final Report
- Metadata Form
- Dataset or Data Plan

## Curating Data

The Wrangler is responsible for curating the researcher data following the directions in the [Curation section.](https://nantucketbiodiversity.github.io/NBIdigitalrepo/curation/)


## Metadata Submission

After receiving the final report and the data (or data plan), the Wrangler is responsible for using the researcher submitted metadata form and the Wrangler's own knowledge of the project to submit metadata for eventual upload to Zenodo.  If the researcher chooses to submit data later, the Wrangler will submit the Data Plan along with the metadata. The Wrangler will use an online form made available by NBI to do this.  At this point the Wrangler's direct responsibilities end.

## Preparing for Upload

Once a year a designated member of NBI, hereafter the *Ringleader*, assembles all the submissions from the previous grant period.  The Ringleader checks the tracking spreadsheet to look for data that has expired embargo dates and adds them to the current submission set.  After making sure there are metadata submissions for every file ready for upload, the Wrangler is ready to begin the upload process.
