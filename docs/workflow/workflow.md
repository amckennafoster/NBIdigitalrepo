# Workflow
Overview of process tailored to the NBI committee member curator/wrangler's point of view; who is a curator, how curators and researchers work together to get content into the repository

## Overview

**Definitions of Roles**

- Researcher: The person or representative of the group of people who produced research outputs that are within the scope of the Repository.

- Wrangler: The NBI committee member who facilitates an NBI funded (or other) researcher's work and has the most knowledge of the individual project.

- Uploader: The NBI committee member who is responsible for uploading each year's worth of research outputs along with any outputs with expired embargoes.

**Researcher Responsibilities:**

Submit a report and metadata form one year after receiving funds from NBI and choose one option for dataset(s):
1. Submit data with report for publication.
2. Submit data with report and agree to the default two year embargo period for publication, or arrange a different embargo timeline.
3. Submit a report only and agree to a custom embargo time period.

**NBI Responsibilities:**

Assist researchers with metadata and data curation to ensure high quality resources on the repository.  High level tasks are:
1. Collect both reports and datasets from reseachers
2. Track embargo periods for individual researchers
3. Curate data to repository standards
4. Apply metadata fully and accurately.
5. Upload research outputs once a year.

## Collecting Reports and Datasets

The Wrangler, the NBI Committee member who works closely with an NBI funded researcher, is the point person for collecting the report and data from the researcher because they are in the best position to apply metadata correctly and easily.  The Wrangler will help the researcher complete three items:

- Final Report
- Data Plan
- Dataset

## Curating Data

If the Wrangler received a dataset, they are responsible for curating the researcher data following the directions in the [Curation section.](https://nantucketbiodiversity.github.io/NBIdigitalrepo/curation/)


## Metadata and File Submission

With the final report, the data plan, and hopefully the curated data in hand, the Wrangler is then responsible for packaging the files and the information about the files (the metadata) for eventual upload to Zenodo. The Wrangler uses a Google Form made available by NBI to record metadata (e.g. title, authors, keywords).  The Wrangler will also move the research output files to a Google Drive folder for later access by the Uploader. If the dataset(s) is to be embargoed, the Wrangler puts the dataset in the embargo folder on Google Drive.  No matter where the dataset goes, the report goes to the annual upload folder.

After this, the Wrangler's direct responsibilities end.

## Preparing for Upload

Once a year, the NBI committee member designated as the *Uploader* assembles all the submissions from the previous grant period.  The Uploader also checks for data that has expired embargo dates, contacts those researchers to get permission to publish, and adds those datasets to the current submission set.  After making sure there are either metadata submissions or an existing Zenodo page for every file ready for upload, the Uploader is ready to begin the upload process.

## Uploading

The Uploader signs into the NBI Zenodo account and uploads all the files for the year.  Metadata is copy and pasted from the metadata spreadsheet created by NBI Wranglers using the Google form.
