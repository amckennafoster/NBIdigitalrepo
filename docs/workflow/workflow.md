# Workflow

## Overview

**Researcher Responsibilities:**

Submit a report and metadata form one year after receiving funds from NBI and choose one option for dataset(s):
1. Submit data with report for publication.
2. Submit data with report and agree to the default two year embargo period for publication, or arrange a different embargo timeline.
3. Submit a report only and agree to submit data within two years at which point it can be further embargoed.

**NBI Responsibilities:**

Assist researchers with metadata and data curation to ensure high quality resources on the repository.  High level tasks are:
1. Collect both reports and datasets from reseachers
2. Track embargo periods for individual researchers
3. Curate data to repository standards
4. Apply metadata fully and accurately.
5. Upload research outputs once a year.
