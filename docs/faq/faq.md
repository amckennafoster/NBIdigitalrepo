# Frequenly Asked Questions

### Overview
In collaboration with Library and Information Science students at the University of Washington Information School, NBI is developing a digital repository for reports and datasets funded by NBI grants.  This will be a searchable database of reports and datasets.  All files will receive a digital object identifier (DOI) making them easily citable.  The digital repository will indefinitely preserve the work that you as a researcher have completed as an NBI grantee.  Submitting dataset(s) with your report whenever possible is important to further open science, increase reproducibility, and make follow up studies more feasible.  

Open science is now the norm.  Read more here:

### What is expectated of NBI grantees?
In addition to the required report, NBI expects every grantee to submit their raw data under the following circumstances:
> The dataset was used in a published paper and is not part of a publication in preparation
> The dataset is unlikely to be part of a publication
> It has been two or more years since the data were collected

### What happens to submitted data?
An NBI committee member will work with you to make sure the dataset is clean and understandable.  This includes determining if the dataset(s) contains sensitive information on rare species or protected areas.

You can request that the dataset be embargoed from publication for a negotiated period.  This is beneficial if you hope to use your data in a paper but in case that does not happen, NBI 
When ready for publication, it will be uploaded with the associated report.

### How will my data be used?

Your data will be used by other researchers, but with the DOI and metadata added to your work, you will be cited approrpiately.
