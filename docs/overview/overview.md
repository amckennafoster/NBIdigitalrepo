# Overview of the NBI Digital Repository

### Overview
NBI is developing a digital repository for reports and datasets produced by NBI funded research. The result will be a searchable database of reports and datasets, all free to download. All files will receive digital object identifiers (DOI) making them easily citable. 

**The digital repository will indefinitely preserve the work that you as a researcher have completed as an NBI grantee.**

Submitting dataset(s) with your report whenever possible is important to further open science, increase reproducibility, and make follow up studies more feasible.

Open science is now the norm across most fields. Read more about the benefits and strategies:

### What is expectated of NBI grantees?
In addition to the required report, NBI expects every grantee to submit their raw data under the following circumstances:
- The dataset was used in a published paper and is not part of a publication in preparation
- The dataset is unlikely to be part of a publication
- It has been two or more years since the data were collected

---

### What happens to submitted data?
An NBI committee member will work with you to make sure the dataset is clean and understandable. An important step is determining if the dataset(s) contains sensitive information on rare species or protected areas. Other steps include data cleaning, application of metadata, and linking to related resources.  Use the top level links on this site to see all the steps used to prepare data for publication.

**Embargo Datasets**

You can request that the dataset be embargoed from publication for a negotiated period.  This is beneficial if you hope to use your data in a paper but are not sure the liklihood of that happening.  In case you are not able to publish, NBI will already have a copy of your data so you will not have to dig it out of the depths of your computer. For more information about how embargoed datasets will be handled, go [here.](https://nantucketbiodiversity.github.io/NBIdigitalrepo/curation/)

When the embargo period ends, NBI will confirm with you that publication is acceptable and it will be uploaded with the associated report.

### How will my data be used?

Your data will be used by other researchers, students, and anyone else! The metadata will make your report and data findable and the DOI will allow others to cite your work correctly.  You can link to your uploaded files from Researchgate or other CV citation management software.  The data and report effectively become another publication for you.

### What does published data look like?

Here are some examples:

[Pick, Postma, and Tschirren 2019 - Prenatal maternal investment in Japanese quail](https://zenodo.org/record/2611152#.XkTacyP9l1s)

[Zizka 2016 - Rare species list in the Neotropics](https://zenodo.org/record/125594#.XkTaLyP9l1s)

Here is the NBI repository: [https://zenodo.org/communities/nantucketbiodiversity/](https://zenodo.org/communities/nantucketbiodiversity/)

### Who hosts the repository?

The repository is hosted on [Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org). Zenodo was developed and is maintained by CERN, the organization that runs the massive particle accelerator in Europe. CERN developed a digital repository for the huge amounts of data produced by the accelerator and opened the repository to all scientists.  You can read the [repository policies here](https://about.zenodo.org/policies/).

The [NBI Repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/nantucketbiodiversity/) is a Community (a organized set of uploaded files) of many on Zenodo.

Zenodo is free and open source.  The source code is on Github (as is all the <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}">supporting documentation</a> for the NBI Repository!)
