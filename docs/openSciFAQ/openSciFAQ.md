# Open Science FAQ



Throughout the world, researchers are becoming more cognizant of the [value and importance of open science](https://theconversation.com/research-transparency-5-questions-about-open-science-answered-76851). As scientific research becomes highly data-driven and reliant on computing, scientists are conscious of the growing need to share data and code to reduce wasteful duplication and increase the rate of discoveries. Additionally, open science is seen as a way to combat the reproducibility crisis identified in many fields.  And finally, as Dr. Ainstworth points out in her [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-bemNZ-IqA), "Open science could be the gateway to a more inclusive and supportive culture." There is a movement to move everything in academia to an open structure, such as open access to literature, open educational resources, open peer review, and open data. 

Since open science is relatively new, researchers usually have some hesitancy in making their work available for anyone to use.  The benefits, however, outweigh any risks.  Both established and early [career researhers](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000246) may benefit from increased [publications, funding, and career advancement](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800).

Researchers can use open science practices to facilitate publishing, communicate scientific knowledge in the media, raise their profile in the scientific community, and increase funding.
