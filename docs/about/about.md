# About the NBI Digital Repository

## In Progress

This repository came out of a collaboration between the Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative (NBI) and library students at the University of Washington Information School.  As a consortium of non profit organizations, NBI faced the problem of tracking completed research and making research outputs available to everyone.
