# About the NBI Digital Repository

## In Progress

This repository came out of a collaboration between the Nantucket Biodiversity Initiative (NBI) and a team of library and information science graduate students at the University of Washington Information School.  As a consortium of non profit organizations, NBI faced the problem of tracking completed research and making research outputs available to everyone.

## About UW iSchool

The [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) trains students to be information professionals with an emphasis on the technologies through which information is delivered.  The iSchool offeres an undergraduate informatics degree, a Master's degree in information management, and a Master's degree in library and information science.  Both Master's programs require a culminating [Capstone project](https://ischool.uw.edu/capstone).  This digital repository is the Capstone project for a team of library and informaiton science graduate students in 2020.
