# How Data is used in the NBI Digital Repository

The NBI Digital Repository is a collection of data and reports, maintained by NBI, hosted on Zenodo. Zenodo is a free, open-source platform created by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, to preserve scientific data. Each report and dataset is given a digital object identifier (DOI) upon upload that permanently links to it. This allows content hosted on Zenodo to be easily accessed with credit given to the appropriate author(s). 

## Access

The NBI Data Repository serves as biodiversity ecosystem in which researchers can store and share their own scientific data and access public datasets that are complementary in nature.

## Re-Use

Researchers can use scientific data to perform analysis to answer research questions and make their work openly visible to other researchers, which welcomes collaboration, and allows others to build on their work.

## Citation

When data have been shared, researchers are required to acknowledge the dataset they have used and cite as support for findings, just as literature is cited. In the case where data are re-used for analytical purposes, it should be cited as well. This method acknowledges the value of the data, and ensures credit to researchers.

## Errors 
Each report and dataset contained within the NBI Digital Repository is uploaded individually. We have designed the repository and workflow to minimize errors, but it may still happen. If you spot an error, please contact an NBI committee member.
