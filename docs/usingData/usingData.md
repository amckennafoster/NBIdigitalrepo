# How Data is used in the NBI Data Repository

The NBI Data Repository is designed to provide the scientific community with resources for storing, sharing, and analyzing scientific datasets.

# Access

The NBI Data Repository serves as biodiversity ecosystem in which researchers can store and share their own scientific data and access public datasets that are complementary in nature.  

Note:
Who can see it
How does it work?

# Re-Use

Researchers can use scientific data to perform analysis to answer research questions and make their work openly visible to other researchers, which welcomes collaboration, and allows others to build on their work. 

Note:

Licensing

# Citation

When data have been shared, researchers are required to acknowledge the dataset they have used and cite as support for findings, just as literature is cited. In the case where data are re-used for analytical purposes, it should be cited as well. This method acknowledges the value of the data, and ensures credit to researchers.
