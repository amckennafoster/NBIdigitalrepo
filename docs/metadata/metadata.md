# Metadata

## Metadata Overview
Good metadata is essential to making reports and datasets findable and usable.  Metadata gives context to a resource and without it, that resource (the report and dataset) will never be used again or, even worse, never even accessed again.  All your hard curation work will be for naught!

>"To data users, good metadata is like summer rain after a long drought- it's refreshing and you don't know when you'll see it again." -the authors of this documentation :)
