# Metadata

## Metadata Overview
Good metadata is essential to making reports and datasets findable and usable.  Metadata gives context to a resource and without it, that resource (the report and dataset) will never be used again or, even worse, never even accessed again.  All your hard curation work will be for naught!

>"To data users, good metadata is like summer rain after a long drought- it's refreshing and you don't know when you'll see it again." -the authors of this documentation :)


## Applying Metadata



## Next Steps


# Using the Metadata Form
Researchers (is this supposed to be curators??) are required to submit metadata related to their reports and datasets to NBI via the Metadata Form. 

Date: If the exact date is unknown enter as much information as is available, with the year as a minimum. If the day or month is unknown, enter it as "01", for example: 01/01/2020

Authors: If the author's ORCID is unknown, leave blank.

Locations: The first three primary locations are the islands, please choose as appropriate to your study. THe second set of locations are more specific. If your study had more than two specific locations, add additional specific locations as keywords in the free text box below. 

Methods: Choose two methods used to collect data in your study. If you used more than two methods add them as additional keywords in the free text box below.

Kingdom: Choose the kingdom that the subject of your study is classified in. If your study focuses on subjects in more than one kingdom, add another kingdom as an additional keyword in the free text box below. Examples of this could include ecosystem analysis, symbiotic relationships, etc.

**If you believe that keywords should be added to the metadata form but do not reflect the content of your study, please do not add them in the free text box. The metadata collected from this form is used to describe your work so we strive for it to be as accurate as possible. If you would like to suggest keywords to be added to the metadata form, please do so here.**

Notes- There are several duplicates within the current controlled vocabs for specific locations. Ex: Coskata, coskata nbi plot; tom never, tom never's pond; folger's marsh, folger marsh nbi plot.
