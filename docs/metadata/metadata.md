# Metadata Overview

Good metadata is essential to making reports and datasets findable and usable.  Metadata gives context to a resource and without it, that resource (the report and dataset) will never be used again or, even worse, never even accessed again.  All your hard curation work will be for naught!

>"To data users, good metadata is like summer rain after a long drought- it's refreshing and you don't know when you'll see it again." -the authors of this documentation :)


# Applying Metadata


The NBI Wrangler submits metadata related to the report and dataset to NBI via the **Metadata Form**. The fields are set up to match what is available on Zenodo.  Once a year, the NBI Uploader (the committee member responsible for uploading to Zenodo) will use the information entered into the Metadata Form to fill in values on Zenodo.

### Date
If the exact date is unknown enter as much information as is available, with the year as a minimum. If the day or month is unknown, enter it as "01", for example: 01/01/2020

### Authors 
If the author's ORCID is unknown, leave blank.

### Locations
**General Geography**- The General Geography locations are the islands or other land masses, please choose as appropriate to your study. 

**Specific Locations**- The second set of locations are more specific. If your study had more than six specific locations, add additional specific locations as keywords in the free text keyword box.  However, please do not enter more than 10 total specific locations.  

Specific locations may include properties, generally accepted place names, property owner (e.g. Nantucket Conservation Foundation), or geographic feature (e.g. pond, hill, beach).
 

### Methods
Choose two methods used to collect data in your study. If you used more than two methods add them as additional keywords in the free text box below.  Methods are the ways data was acquired, not the way it was analyzed.

### Study Type
Study type is how the collected data is analyzed or what it produces.  Examples include: checklist, species survey, genetic analysis, species-area curve, etc.

### Kingdom 
Choose the kingdom that the subject of your study is classified in. If your study focuses on subjects in more than one kingdom, add another kingdom as an additional keyword in the free text box below. 

### Free Text Keywords
Examples of this could include ecosystem analysis, symbiotic relationships, etc.

**If you believe that keywords should be added to the metadata form but do not reflect the content of your study, please do not add them in the free text box. The metadata collected from this form is used to describe your work so we strive for it to be as accurate as possible. If you would like to suggest keywords to be added to the metadata form, please do so here.**

Notes

- Some reports use only GPS coordiantes for the locations of study sites. Ex: Quinby 2017 - Evaluation of the Prey Base and Feeding Relationships of the American Burying Beetle (Nicrophorus americanus) on Nantucket Island. For these, how do we capture the specific location metadata?
- Should we suggest that checklists be submitted on the form as a Report rather than Dataset?
- We should add a page or section that shows what the controlled vocabularies are.  It would be good to link to that content from the how to use data page.
- Researcher metadata form: author names, ORCID, affiliations; contributor names/affiliations, desired report title, desired dataset title, If dataset, publication restrictions.
