# What Types are Allowed?

## In Progress

All file types should be 'open' meaning a user does not need propriatary software to open and use the file.


## Data

#### CSV Comma Separated Values

CSV is a standard format for open data.  Most spreadsheet programs (like Excel) will allow you to save a file as .csv.  All formatting is stripped away.

#### TXT Text file

Data can also be saved as a text file as long as there is a way for a spreadsheet program to figure out how the data values are separated from each other.

## Reports

#### PDF

PDF is the preferred report format.  Almost any word processor can export a document to the pdf format.  There are online tools to combine several pdfs into one.

## Images

#### TIFF

#### PNG
