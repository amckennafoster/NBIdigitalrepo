## Expectations for NBI Researchers

## In Progress

A researcher who receives an NBI grant is expected to submit a report of their work by February 15 of the following year.  Additionally, NBI expects researchers to work with an NBI committee member to create a data plan.  This plan may entail submitting raw data with the report or submitting the data at a later agreed upon date.

### Report Expectations

The report can be in a format that is appropriate to the research.  At a minimum please include a title, author(s) and affiliation(s), an abstract, and a description of the methods and results. Where applicable, the report should include inventory data and voucher specimens of all species collected (properly prepared with a full set of geo-referenced data).

### Data Expectations

Ideally, the data should be cleaned by the researcher following the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/curation/">curation protocol</a>.  An NBI committee member can assist with this process.  Data should not be summarized.  The goal of publishing data is that a current or future researcher can build upon your work.
