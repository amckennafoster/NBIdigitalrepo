## Embargoed Datasets

It is ideal to have a copy of a researcher's data even if they do not want it published immediately.  This reduces the possibility that the data will be lost.  

- If a dataset is ready to be published with the associated report it can be put with other files ready for upload.
- If a researcher requests a dataset be embargoed, put the dataset file in a folder titled with the year it should be published. Put the associated report with other files ready for upload and note in the metadata record what year the data will be published.

(borrowed from previous page, include?)
Enter the embargo information in this field and note why the data is embargoed and what month and year it should be published.

Researchers have the option to submit their data with their report to NBI under an agreed upon embargo restriction postponing publication to a future date. The benefit of embargoing is that NBI holds a copy of the data in case the researcher either loses the dataset or goes incommunicado. Additionally, timely submission of data means the NBI Wrangler can curate the dataset while the project is fresh on the mind.

Here is an example: A PhD student hopes to publish a paper based on their data as part of their dissertation. They think it will be 2.5 years before publication. The researcher agrees to submit data with their report but have it embargoed for 2.5 years. At the end of their grant year, NBI receives the report and dataset. The report is published immediately. The NBI Wrangler curates the dataset and puts it in a folder marked with the date of publication. In 2.5 years, NBI contacts the researcher to get final confirmation for data publication.

The recommended license is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. This allows maximum reusability and requires users to cite this upload. For more information on the world of open data licenses see [Specifications & Technical Details](https://nantucketbiodiversity.github.io/NBIdigitalrepo/specs/).


## Other fields in Zenodo
References, Journal, Conference, Book/Reports/Chapter, Thesis all are used if the document is an actual publication that does not have a doi from its publication source.  These are unlikely to be used by NBI.  An example of use would be if and NBI organization's staff publishes a paper or a report in some publication and is allowed to make it public.  The document could be uploaded to the repository as the authoritative copy and the publication information would be added the the pertinent fields listed in this section.
