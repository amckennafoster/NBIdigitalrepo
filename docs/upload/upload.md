## Embargoed Datasets
# Scheduling for Publication

## In Progress

It is ideal to have a copy of a researcher's data even if they do not want it published immediately.  This reduces the possibility that the data will be lost.  

- If a dataset is ready to be published with the associated report it can be put with other files ready for upload.
- If a researcher requests a dataset be embargoed, put the dataset file in a folder titled with the year it should be published. Put the associated report with other files ready for upload and note in the metadata record what year the data will be published.




## Other fields in Zenodo
References, Journal, Conference, Book/Reports/Chapter, Thesis all are used if the document is an actual publication that does not have a doi from its publication source.  These are unlikely to be used by NBI.  An example of use would be if and NBI organization's staff publishes a paper or a report in some publication and is allowed to make it public.  The document could be uploaded to the repository as the authoritative copy and the publication information would be added the the pertinent fields listed in this section.
