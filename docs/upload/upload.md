## Embargoed Datasets

## Other fields in Zenodo
References, Journal, Conference, Book/Reports/Chapter, Thesis all are used if the document is an actual publication that does not have a doi from its publication source.  These are unlikely to be used by NBI.  An example of use would be if and NBI organization's staff publishes a paper or a report in some publication and is allowed to make it public.  The document could be uploaded to the repository as the authoritative copy and the publication information would be added the the pertinent fields listed in this section.
